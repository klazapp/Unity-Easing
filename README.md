# Easing Utility for Unity

## Introduction
The `Easing` utility, part of the `com.Klazapp.Utility` namespace, is designed to control the rate of change of a value over time, often used for creating smooth and natural animations. Easing functions define the interpolation or transition between two values, providing more control over the acceleration or deceleration during animations. These functions are widely used in game development, user interface design, and other interactive applications to achieve visually pleasing and realistic animations.

## Features
- Help in achieving smooth and gradual changes in properties such as position, scale, rotation, and opacity over time.
- Used for transitioning between menus, panels, or UI elements to create a visually appealing user experience.
- ften leverage third-party tweening libraries that provide pre-built easing functions and simplify the process of creating animations.

## Dependencies
To use `Easing`, certain dependencies are required. Ensure these are included in your Unity project.
